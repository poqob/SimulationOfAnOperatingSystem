# SimulationOfAnOperatingSystem

SimulationOfAnOperatingSystem is a Java application that simulates the fundamental components and
functions of an operating system. This application has been developed for educational purposes to
__understand how an operating system works.__

## Features

This application simulates the following features of an operating system:

- **Processor:** Mimics the logic, instruction set, and register files of the CPU.
- **Memory:** Performs addressing, read, and write operations in RAM.
- **Disk:** Creates a file system on the hard disk, reads, writes, and deletes files.
- **Process:** Manages process creation, termination, pausing, and resuming operations.
- **Processor Scheduler:** Sequences processes, prioritizes them, and executes them with time
  sharing.
- **Input/Output:** Manages input devices such as keyboards and mice, and output devices such as
  screens.

## Installation

To run this application, you will need Eclipse or Android Studio with Java support. Additionally,
Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher must be installed.

Follow these steps to install the application:

- Clone or download this repository.
- Open the SimulationOfAnOperatingSystem project in Eclipse or Android Studio.
- Right-click on the project in the Project Explorer and select Build.
- Click on the Run button or press F5.

## Usage

Before you run the application, fill the **entry.txt** properly. The 'entry.txt' file covers
processes for each line.
Each column in a row has a meaning for a process let's take a look at this.
In a sequence:

- process arrival time
- process priority
- process execution time
- process memory requirement
- process printer requirement
- process scanner requirement
- process modem requirement
- process cd driver requirement

After defining processes, that will be simulated by the application; run the application by pressing
f5 on IDE.
each process has different color on console watch their status and analyze them via this
application.
